    <p id="wick-style" align="center" style="font-family: 'Yellowtail', cursive; font-size: 20px">
        Johnathan "John" Wick (born Jardani Jovonovich) is a legendary hitman who previously worked for the
        Tarasov Mob until his retirement. He retired in order to spend time with his wife, Helen Wick,
        who later died of an unidentified illness. His superior, Viggo Tarasov, promised to allow John
        to quit if he first completed an "impossible task": killing all of Tarasov's enemies in a single night.
        Having succeeded, John retired and lived peacefully for just over five years.

    <p id="naruto-style" align="center">
        Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tails attacked Konohagakure, destroying much of the village and taking many lives. The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children — taking their cues from their parents — inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged, Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.

    <p id="hobbit-style" align="center">
        The Hobbit is a film series consisting of three high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. The three films are The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).[5] The films are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to The Return of the King, which expand on the story told in The Hobbit, as well as new material and characters written especially for the films. Together they act as a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.
