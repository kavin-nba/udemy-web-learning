different types of forces

F=G


1)It obayes the inverse of square law
2)It is always atractiv in nature
3)It is a long range force it extends up to infinity
4)It is the weakest force of the nature
5)it is the central force and a consrvative force
6)the graviton is the field particals for gravitational force




a graviton partical is the partical present between two objects



electromagnetic force

1) it happens between two charged particles 
2) it also obeys inverse square law
3) it may be atractive or repusive in nature 
4) it is also a long range force
5) photon is the field particle between the force
6) it is 10*36 times greater than the gravitational force
7) it is also a central as well as a conservative force

strong nuclear force

1)the force that responsible for the intraction between the elementary pariticals and the nucleons inside the nucles is called strong nuclear force
 
 properties:
2)it is a short range force and is operative only over the size of the nucleus
3)it is basicaly an atractive force
4)the pi meson is the feild partical of the nuclear force
5)it is the strongest force operating the nature it os 10*38 times than gravitaional and 100times than electromagnetic force
it is a non central force

weak nuclear force

1)it also exsit between the particals
a neutrino actts as a field partical force

it 10*25 times than tthe gravitational force but weak than rest

when an neutron changes into proton it emits an electron andf an uncharged partical called nutrino in which the weak nuclear force is responsibile
it is a shortrange it is 10*-15
