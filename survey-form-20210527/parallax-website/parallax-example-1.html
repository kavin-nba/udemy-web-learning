    Johnathan "John" Wick (born Jardani Jovonovich) is a legendary hitman who previously worked for the
            Tarasov Mob until his retirement. He retired in order to spend time with his wife, Helen Wick,
            who later died of an unidentified illness. His superior, Viggo Tarasov, promised to allow John
            to quit if he first completed an "impossible task": killing all of Tarasov's enemies in a single night.
            Having succeeded, John retired and lived peacefully for just over five years.
