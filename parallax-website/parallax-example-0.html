    Johnathan "John" Wick (born Jardani Jovonovich) is a legendary hitman who previously worked for the
            Tarasov Mob until his retirement. He retired in order to spend time with his wife, Helen Wick,
            who later died of an unidentified illness. His superior, Viggo Tarasov, promised to allow John
            to quit if he first completed an "impossible task": killing all of Tarasov's enemies in a single night.
            Having succeeded, John retired and lived peacefully for just over five years.

        <p id="naruto-style" align="center">
    Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tails attacked Konohagakure, destroying much of
            the village and taking many lives. The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his
            life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was
            shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself.
            Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children
            — taking their cues from their parents — inherited the same animosity towards Naruto.
            In his thirst to be acknowledged, Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the
            village had ever seen.
