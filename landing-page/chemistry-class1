n=  1   2   3  4 
      K L M N  shell
as the n value increases the orbital increaces
if the orbital is in k shell the energy is low if in the n the energy is high

sub shells   are represented by s p d t
if l = 0 then s

n=1 k then l=0
n=2 l then l=0,1
n=3 m then l=0,1,2
n=4 n then l=0,1,2,3

gives complete detail about the 




when n value increases the orbital increases


4 set of quantum number

(1) principal quantum number(n)
(2) azimuthal quantum number(l)
(3) magnetic quantum number(ml)
(4) spin quantum number(ms)  

(1) used to find out the size of the orbital and the energy level of the electron.
(2)using this we can predict the number of sub shell present in the shell
sub shells   are represented by s p d t
if l = 0 then s

n=1 k then l=0
n=2 l then l=0,1
n=3 m then l=0,1,2
n=4 n then l=0,1,2,3
angular momentum formula
root of l(l+1)  h/2 pi
h=6.626


(3)it used to find no of orbital and used to arangement of the orbital
ml=-l ....... +l

(4) we can identify the direction of the eletrron spin
